    Enjoying Tea and Coffee at a local Cafe with friends while waiting for the Chiesa della Santissima TrinitÃ  dei Pellegrini to open.
    They usually open 15 minutes before the Mass and we had to wait until 23:30 on 24th December 2019 for the Midnight Mass.

    Although I had no idea how to even hold the chopsticks, I really enjoyed this lunch!
    We did go to a Japanese Restaurant, but we forgot to take the photos! ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜¢

    I completely don't remember the name of this restaurant except that it was underground.
    We had to go through narrow stairs and our table was arranged near the barriques. It was a beautiful dining experience.
