  <h2><strong>About Rome: Culture, Traditions and More</strong></h2>
  <p>
    I arrived in Roma Aeroporto with my good friend John on 22nd December 2019. The majestic feeling in my heart when I first saw the city in its beautiful
    streetlights and the amusing graffiti all across the walls of the streets as well as on the pavements is indescribable.
    Fr. Mathew had told us that the day we arrive in Rome is our Roman B'day: A day that we must celebrate and cherish every year in memory of Rome.
    It is hard to beat the Italians when it comes to singing songs in public, drinking in groups and generally, in creating an eccentric atmosphere.
    Truly, the days in Rome were numbered but the memories that we made in Rome cannot be counted!
    Rome is what Home feels like - especially when you're away from Home!

    While in Rome, we got to live and experience the enriched culture that it offered us. One of the breath-taking moments was the picture below -
    A painting of Nativity on the City's square.
